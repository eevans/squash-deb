Contributing to Squash is similar to contributing to most other
open-source projects.  Requirements which you may or may not have
encountered with other projects include:

  + You are required to sign a contributor license agreement (CLA).
    Our CLA does not assign copyright, and its terms should not be
    objectionable to anyone without malicious intent.
  + Commit messages must be well-formed and informative.
  + You must PGP-sign all commits.

* Signing the CLA

  Before we can accept a contribution from Squash, you must sign the
  contributor license agreement (in docs/CLA/CLA.txt).  The agreement
  is copied from the Linux Kernel, and does *not* require copyright
  assignment.  It is short and easy to understand, so you should have
  no problem reviewing the text.  Please use your real name; no
  pseudonyms or aliases.

  Once you have read the CLA, and assuming you agree to it, you should
  cryptographically sign it with your PGP key.  If you don't already
  have a PGP key, please generate one.  There are a vast number of
  tutorials online explaining how to generate a key, so it will not be
  explained here.

  If you are Using GPG, generating the signature you should use something like:

    gpg --output Your-Name.sig --detach-sign CLA.txt

  Then git add Your-Name.sig and commit it:

    git add Your-Name.sig
    git commit -S -m 'Sign CLA.'

  This should be the only change in this commitâ€”please do not combine it
  with other changes.

  After making sure that the address used in your git commit matches
  one of the addresses associated with your public key, a developer
  will send an encrypted e-mail to that address to verify your
  identity, so please make sure to export your signature to a key
  server:

    gpg --send-key KEYID

  From this point on you can pretty much send patches however you
  prefer; pull requests on github, use `git format-patch` and attach
  the resulting file(s) to an issue, or use `git send-email` to send a
  patch set to the mailing list (squash-compression@googlegroups.com).

* Commit Messages

  The format used by Squash for commit messages is the de-facto
  standard used by a lot of open-source projects, so if you've ever
  contributed to a project which cares about commit messages before
  you're probably already familiar with the rules.

  All lines in a commit message must be less than or equal to 72
  characters long, with the exception of lines which contain
  non-breaking text (such as a link or code fragment).

  The first line must be a short summary of the change, preceeded by a
  component name if applicable.

  If the summary is insufficient to fully describe the change it
  should be followed by as many paragraphs as are necessary in order
  to do so.

  Finally, if the patch relates to an issue, a link to that issue.

* Signing Your Commits

  Please sign all your commits (with the key you used to sign the CLA)
  by passing the -S flag to git commit.
